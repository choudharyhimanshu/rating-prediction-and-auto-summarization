### Dataset : Amazon Fine Food Reviews ###

The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of 568,454 food reviews Amazon users left up to October 2012. Each review in the dataset contains a user submitted rating, user submitted review and summary.

### Objectives ###

In the project we seek to implement two separate tasks on the chosen dataset - Rating Generation from Review Text and Auto summarization of Review Text.

1. **Rating Generation : **
We will implement two different approaches to generate reviews and compare their relative effectiveness in our chosen task. A Dictionary based Lexicon approach and a Machine Learning Supervised Linear Classifier.

2. **Auto Summarization : **
Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining is the backbone of the Auto Summarization
task. The scope of the autosummarizer differs from the norm as its objective would be to return 3-5 word phrases given 4-5 line reviews. We would also require implementing and using Word2Vec or similar to compare our generated summaries with the user submitted ones.
